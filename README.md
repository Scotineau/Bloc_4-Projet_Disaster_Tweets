# Bloc_4-Projet_Disaster_Tweets

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
* EDA of the dataset
* Build a model that predicts if a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## Deliverable ðŸ“¬
* Two kinds of models have been built : "Machine Learning" model (Logistic Regression), and "Deep Learning" models (embedding, SimpleRNN, GRU and LSTM).
* Concerning "Deep Learning", almost all models overfit, and the val_loss curve remains too high. Maybe the use of transfert learning could be a better approach (like BERT).
* The result of the Logistic Regression is quite good even if we have overfitting.
